# Introduction

This project aims to predict personality types and emotional states from text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, we are building models capable of interpreting user text to predict their MBTI personality type and recognize emotional expressions. These insights can contribute to improved user interactions, enhanced personalization, and an enriched understanding of language patterns related to personality and emotions.

# Project Objectives

This project is driven by the following objectives:

1. **Predict MBTI Personality Types**:
    - Develop models capable of accurately predicting MBTI personality types based on textual data.
    - Use embeddings and neural architectures (Word2Vec, GloVe with LSTM and GRU) to optimize the prediction of MBTI types.

2. **Emotion Detection**:
    - Train emotion-detection models to identify emotions in user text, leveraging the GoEmotions dataset and BERT-based transformer models.
    - Achieve high accuracy in detecting and differentiating emotional states (such as joy, sadness, anger).

3. **Enhance User Experience through Personalization**:
    - Integrate personality and emotion predictions into potential applications that personalize user experiences based on individual emotional and personality profiles.
    - Provide an adaptive user interaction that could be applied in mental health, customer service, and recommendation systems.

# Literature Review

The fields of personality and emotion detection in textual data are interdisciplinary, spanning psychology, computational linguistics, and machine learning:

1. **Personality Prediction**:
    - Prior studies have explored MBTI prediction using social media text, with research suggesting that linguistic patterns correlate with MBTI traits. Notable work includes [reference studies], which utilize word embeddings to capture personality dimensions.
    - Research by Michal Kosinski and colleagues has highlighted the ability to predict personality traits based on digital footprints, inspiring our choice of textual data for MBTI classification.

2. **Emotion Detection**:
    - Emotion detection models have been substantially enhanced by transformer architectures, particularly BERT, which has shown high effectiveness in handling contextual information. The GoEmotions dataset by Google provides a comprehensive foundation for building robust emotion classification models.
    - Applications of emotion recognition include psychological well-being analysis, enhancing user satisfaction, and personalizing human-computer interaction.

# Methodology

Our methodology involves multiple stages, including data preparation, model training, testing, and evaluation. Here’s an overview of each step:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    - Data for personality prediction is sourced from the **MBTI Essays** dataset, while emotion detection uses the **GoEmotions** dataset.
    - Text data is cleaned and preprocessed through tokenization, lowercasing, and contraction expansion. Emojis and emoticons are converted to descriptive text, and URLs are normalized to enhance model consistency.

2. **Embedding and Tokenization**:
    - **Word Embeddings**: GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings are utilized to convert text into numerical vectors representing word semantics.
    - **Transformer Tokenization**: BERT tokenization is applied in the emotion detection model to capture sentence-level context.

3. **Model Training and Selection**:
    - **Personality Prediction Models**: Multiple architectures, including **GloVe-LSTM**, **GloVe-GRU**, **Word2Vec-LSTM**, and **Word2Vec-GRU**, are trained and evaluated. Personality is predicted across four dimensions (I/E, S/N, T/F, J/P).
    - **Emotion Detection Model**: BERT-based transformers are used to train emotion detection models, leveraging fine-tuning and transfer learning to optimize performance.

4. **Testing and Evaluation**:
    - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores are computed to assess model performance.
    - Confidence scores are evaluated to ensure reliability in MBTI and emotion predictions.
