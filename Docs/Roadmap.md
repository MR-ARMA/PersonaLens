2. **Model Training**: Train emotion detection model using BERT embeddings.
3. **Evaluation**: Validate the emotion detection model on test data, compute accuracy and F1 scores.

#### Estimated Time:
- **Weeks**: 3 weeks (120 hours)

---

### Phase 4: Model Testing and Validation

**Goal:** Evaluate and refine both personality and emotion models for robustness and reliability.

#### Tasks:
1. **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.
2. **Error Analysis**: Conduct error analysis to identify common misclassifications.
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Integrate confidence scoring for predictions.

#### Estimated Time:
- **Weeks**: 2 weeks (80 hours)
